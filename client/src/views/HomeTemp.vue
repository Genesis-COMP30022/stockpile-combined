        <p>This is a temporary home page that will have real contents soon. 
           In the meantime, try clicking the Stockpile logo to visit the main
           cards view, or use the menu drawer!</p>
        <p>(Several menu items will be highlighted when you open this page. 
            This is normal -- they currently all link to the same page.
            That'll change, obviously.)</p>
