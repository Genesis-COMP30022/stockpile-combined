Stockpile is an home inventory management CRUD app that can manage inventory/costs, user privilages, and generate reports based on usage.

You may visit the fully deployed version of Stockpile [here](https://app.stockpileapp.au/), or https://app.stockpileapp.au .

Details of the development process, technologies used and more can be found in Team Genesis' Confluence page [here](https://bttan.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GENESIS/pages/9371649/README+Current+designs+diagrams).

The application can be modified and launched locally, if desired. 
Note that the application is divided into two: 
  The client (front-end), located in ```/src```, 
  and the server (back-end), in ```/backend```.

## Project setup
